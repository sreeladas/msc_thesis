The geometric reconstruction of shower direction at the VERITAS imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT) system sees a substantial degradation at large zenith angles ($\phi>45^\circ$). A machine-learning-based reconstruction of this direction is not expected to suffer from the same limitations because it does not rely on the geometry of the observation. In this work, we demonstrate the predicted efficiency of a reconstruction using boosted decision trees. We also test how well this translates to a data analysis by performing a proof of concept with compact and point-source objects.
